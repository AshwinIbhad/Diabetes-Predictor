### Description
  - Early detection of the disease lowers medical expenditures as well as the likelihood of people developing more severe health problems.
  - It requires no laboratory testing and has been validated in multiple populations
  - The project helps the user to identify whether someone is suffering from diabetes by simply inputting certain values like BMI, Glucose level, Blood pressure etc. with the help   of a Kaggle database.
  - By using the statistical data about how certain aspects like BMI, Glucose level, Insulin level, age etc. impact if an individual is prone to diabetes or not, the project will    be able to tell the user if the person has diabetes or not by entering those values.
  -  So in a way the project will help in monitoring the likelihood of someone developing diabetes. The project can be extended to include other diseases prediction which I will     incorporate later down the road.
